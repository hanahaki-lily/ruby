# Ruby Bot – Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 16, 2026  

This Privacy Policy explains how Ruby Bot collects, uses, and protects user data.

---

## 1. Information Collected
Ruby Bot collects only the data necessary to provide its features:

- **Discord ID and username** – to track XP, levels, gems, and card collections.  
- **Server ID** – to separate server-specific data.  
- **Bot interactions** – commands used, XP earned, card draws, and economy interactions.

Ruby Bot does **not** collect sensitive personal information such as emails, passwords, IP addresses, or payment details.

## 2. Use of Data
Collected data is used solely for:

- Managing user progression (XP, levels, gems)  
- Tracking gacha collections  
- Displaying leaderboards  
- Enabling moderation and developer commands

Data is **stored locally** in JSON files and is **not shared with third parties**, except as required by law.

## 3. Data Retention
- User data is retained while the user is part of a server that uses Ruby Bot.  
- If a user leaves a server, their server-specific data is automatically removed.  
- Administrators may remove data for maintenance, abuse prevention, or at user request.

## 4. Data Security
- Data is stored securely in local JSON files accessible only to authorized developers.  
- While reasonable measures are taken to secure user data, no system is completely secure. Users acknowledge this risk.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Ruby Bot does not share data with third-party services. However, interactions with Discord’s API are logged per Discord’s normal operation.

## 6. User Rights
- You may request deletion of your data by contacting the Bot owner.  
- You may opt out of specific features by not using them (e.g., economy commands or gacha draws).

## 7. Changes to Privacy Policy
The Bot owner may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Users will be notified via the official server or website.

## 8. Contact
